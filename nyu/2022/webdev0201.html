            As We May Think -- Vannevar Bush, 1945 
            </h2>
            <p style= "background-color: darkolivegreen;">
            The understanding of science has been the essential foundation for mankind’s standard
            of living since the distance of time. While this understanding has exponentially<br>
            progressed, the potential and objectives of many research fields seemed to peak in war<br>
            technologies. However, Dr. Vannevar Bush proposed a new incentive for the application<br>
            of science beyond warfare— the “memex.” Bush felt the most orderly way to proceed<br>
            with the potential of human intelligence would require access to the sum of knowledge<br>
            thus far. The memex would then serve as a personal mechanized library of records and<br>
            communications, to efficiently aid the individual user by searching through a sea of data.<br>
            If the memex was successfully built, it would bridge the complications regarding<br>
            preservation, compression, and accessibility of knowledge.<br>
