            As We May Think -- Vannevar Bush, 1945 
            </h2>

            The understanding of science has been the essential foundation for mankind’s standard<br>
            of living since the distance of time. While this understanding has exponentially<br>
            progressed, the potential and objectives of many research fields seemed to peak in war<br>
            technologies. However, Dr. Vannevar Bush proposed a new incentive for the application<br>
            of science beyond warfare— the “memex.” Bush felt the most orderly way to proceed<br>
            with the potential of human intelligence would require access to the sum of knowledge<br>
            thus far. The memex would then serve as a personal mechanized library of records and<br>
            communications, to efficiently aid the individual user by searching through a sea of data.<br>
            If the memex was successfully built, it would bridge the complications regarding<br>
            preservation, compression, and accessibility of knowledge.<br>

                Long Live the Web -- Tim Berners-Lee, 2010 
            </h2>

            Since its creation, the Web has been consistently relied upon, more and more heavily<br>
            so, into its role today as an indispensable understructure of culture and society. Tim<br>
            Berners-Lee believes this is due to its formation from egalitarian principles and its<br>
            original role as a public resource. However, Berners-Lee feels that the value of the Web<br>
            is being threatened by numerous groups who look to monopolize users for profit, often<br>
            at the cost of violating privacy and human rights. Actions may include jeopardizing<br>
            universality by exclusively containing user information; ISP snooping to access<br>
            undisclosed information; or controlling accessibility to certain sites through bias or<br>
            business deals. In Berners-Lee's perspective, the once open standards of the Web are<br>
            steadily being closed off. Society needs to desperately defend the open Web as it is the<br>
            strongest extension of our human rights.<br>
